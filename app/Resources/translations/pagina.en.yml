pagina.cuerpo_virgen_extra: <p>It is extracted exclusively by mechanical procedures with a maximum acidity of 0.8%. This parameter is obtained through a laboratory analysis, and is directly related to the amount of free fatty acids in the oil, which are mainly produced because all the olive is not in its optimal state of health, as with olives Picked from the ground, chopped olives, fermented olives, etc. Therefore, the lower the acidity, the higher the quality of the fruit and the olive oil produced.</p><p>However, acidity is not the only parameter that is taken into account to determine its quality, since other determinants such as the index of peroxides, K270 or waxes influence. But what do these parameters mean? Pieces to simplify, peroxide index is the amount of active oxygen in the oil and not an idea of ​​degree of oxidation or enrichment (defective taste). In the case of extra virgin olive oil, this parameter may not exceed 20 meq / kilogram (milliequivalents of oxygen per kilo). In the same line, the index K270 indicates the degree of oxidation produced by alterations, contamination or improper manipulations of the product. On the other hand, waxes that pass to olive oil due to the presence of leaves or dirt, a high extraction temperature or improper storage. In short, it is an exhaustive analytical test, it is possible to know if an extra virgin olive oil could have been adulterated or present defects that put in doubt its extra virginity, as has already demonstrated the OCU in the controls that makes to detect the frauds so Common (click) with this product. Therefore, when buying an extra virgin olive oil, is a quality that is certified by the Regulatory Board of an authorized Denomination of Origin. In this sense, our O.D. Sierra Mágina is the most demanding in the world and sets a threshold for all these parameters well below what the European regulations. In addition, it has a test panel of experts in catalogs, who perform an analytical analysis to detect defects in extra virgin oil, not revealed by physical-chemical analysis. This human analysis is essential to detect qualities of the oil such as fruity, bitter or spicy, directly related to the presence of organic compounds and unique natural antioxidants such as vitamin E, oleocantal or squalene, which convert virgin olive oil Extra superior in a product of capital importance for our health.</p>

pagina.titulo_virgen: Virgin Olive Oil
pagina.cuerpo_virgen: <p>The virgin olive oil is extracted in the same way as the extra virgin, with the difference that its acidity is usually above 0.8%, but it can not exceed 2%. That is, its content in free fatty acids is usually higher, mainly because the olive is in worse condition. However, it may be that the previous physico-chemical analysis results in parameters that meet all the requirements to be an extra virgin olive oil, and yet an organoleptic analysis by the tasting of experts Determine that it does not meet these requirements, and therefore must be sold in the market as virgin olive oil. That is to say, a virgin olive oil differs basically from an extra virgin, in which the virgin oil presents defects in its taste or smell.</p><p>However, in principle, an oil of this type has enough quality to be consumed without any fear, since it is still olive juice, although the olives with which it was produced, did not have optimum quality. Therefore, it is usually used more for cooking than for its use in raw, because its flavor is usually milder and contains fewer organic compounds and natural antioxidants beneficial to health.</p>

pagina.titulo_lampante: Lampante Oil
pagina.cuerpo_lampante: <p>Lampante oil es the juice resulsts by olives which quality is the worst, normally of the last olives of season, which are picked from floor or fermentation process, and produces results an oil more than 2% heartburn and a lot of imperfections, which makes it not suitable for human use. So, this type of oil goes from olive press to refinery to make another type of oil or deritative. However, some recent controls from OCU to some olive oils stays in very famous supermarkets e hypermarkets, have brought to light the fraudulent use of this product inside labelled packaging as virgin olive oil or extra virgin olive oil. As anecdote, "lampante" goes from lamp, due to old Rome this oil was used as "energy" for streetlight and to feed to slaves as show of their "generosity".</p>

pagina.titulo_picual: Picual
pagina.cuerpo_picual: <p>Originally from Jaén and representing 50% of Spanish production and 20% of the world, it gives an oil of green tones and with predominance of the bitter tastes. Its name comes from the pointed form (peak) of the olive. It is the best variety in the world, and is the majority in the province of Jaén, and the denomination of origin "Sierra Mágina". It is also predominant in the DOs "Sierra de Segura", "Priego de Córdoba", "Montes de Granada" and "Baena". Also called Marteña, Nevado or Nevadillo, among others. It is the most important and widespread variety. Its geographical spread is linked to Andalusia, the main producing region of the world and in particular, to the provinces of Jaén, Córdoba and Granada. Also present in Malaga, Ciudad Real and Badajoz. Nevertheless, it is not very widespread, concentrating its production in the province of Jaén, and bordering areas, where it is dedicated an area of ​​about 645,000 hectares. This variety is protected in the DOs of Sierra Mágina, Sierra Segura, in these two as main variety. Also in Priego de Córdoba, Sierra de Cazorla and Montes de Granada. Olive is medium to large, with 3.2 grams of average. The flesh-to-bone ratio is 5/6. Ripening occurs from the beginning of November to the middle of December. Oil productivity is high, reaching 27.7%, although the average is around 22%. From this variety are obtained the Priego Denominations of Origin of Córdoba, Sierra de Segura and Sierra Mágina.</p><p>The tree presents a great vigor, of branches somewhat short, branched with tendency to produce shoots and pacifiers. Their cups are vigorous and tend to close, with good foliaceous development being the young wood of greyish green color. They have early entry into production and high productivity and this is one of the reasons why both their plantations have intensified. It is a type of tree that adapts to diverse conditions of climate and soil and is frost tolerant, but little resistant to drought and very limestone terrain. Picual olive trees have a high productivity, which is one of the reasons why they have intensified their plantations. The maturation of its fruits takes place from the second week of November to the third of December. It has a high fat yield, a high stability index and a high content of oleic acid. It also offers high resistance to roasting caused by the amount of natural antioxidants it contains. Its high polyphenol content makes it the most stable oil available.</p><p>The excellence of the oil it produces starts with the fatty acid content and antioxidants. It usually contains 80% of monounsaturated oleic acid, an important component in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, and only 4% of linoleic acid, which in excess is harmful. From the organoleptic point of view, it would be necessary to differentiate between the plain and the mountain. Plain oils are large body oils, usually bitter, with a certain woody flavor. The mountain ones are usually milder with a "fresh" flavor and pleasant. Lowland oils often have a lot of body, with a slight bitter taste and a touch of wood, while if olives are grown in mountain lands the oil is sweeter, with a fresher taste. The best use of the oil is to fry, although it is equally good in salads or gazpachos. The oils of picual variety, in their extra virgin quality, are the ideal to cook fish and shellfish. Special for making vegetable sauces, either to take them alone or to make the pepper, tomato and onion sauces that are the basis of stews and sauces. They enhance the flavor of the traditional garlic soups, by frying in extra virgin olive oil the bread to prepare the picatostes. They are suitable for seasoning salads with vegetables with bitter leaves such as endive, endive, chicory, watercress, dandelion, rocket or jaramago, being the most suitable to accompany raw tomatoes minced with fat salt . They enhance the traditional flavor of the so-called frying-fruit (fried roscos, pestiños, borrachuelos), or innumerable confectionery confections such as homemade muffins, giving a flavor replica of the butter of many of these traditional sweets.</p>

pagina.titulo_alberquina: Alberquina
pagina.cuerpo_alberquina: <p>Originally from Arbeca, belonging to the region of Les Garrigues, in Lléida gives rise to oils very aromatic, green at the beginning of harvest, with characteristic olfactory notes such as almond, tomato and apple. It is the most widespread variety in Catalonia, the most renowned and known. This olive is the majority in Lleida (DO Les Garrigues), in Tarragona (DO Siurana). We can also find them in the provinces of Zaragoza, Huesca, Teruel. The oils protected by the Denomination of Origin of Bajo Aragón allow up to 20% of Arbequina olive. It is among the best-known Spanish varieties. Although it reaches the provinces of Saragossa and Huesca, in the community of Aragon, it originates in the town of Arbeca (Lérida), from which comes the name, being widely extended by the provinces of Tarragona and Lérida, both in the Community of Catalonia. The quality of the oil has made these two production areas creditor of two Appellations of Origin; Siurana and Les Garrigues respectively. The olive tree appears in both single crop and associated with others, mainly to vineyards, and sometimes occupying the boundaries between plots.</p><p>Arbequina olive is one of the smallest used to produce olive oil and maintains a low pulp / bone ratio of 4.6. Oval, more rounded than elongated, oval and almost symmetrical in shape, early maturation, green / violet and shiny. Very good grease performance and very good oil quality, produces a very fine oil. Olives do not fall easily because of their small size, about 1.9 grams, and it is difficult to collect them mechanized, so that instead of watering them are milked, ie collected by passing the hand through the branches. It presents the disadvantage of the very small fruits and branches that transmit very badly the vibration during the collection; Bush that allows higher planting densities. Arbequina olive is highly prized for its early entry into production, with an average ripening period between the second week of December and the second of January, high productivity and good fat yield, around 20.5%, and are highly esteemed Because they have a very early incorporation into production. It has high productivity and good fatty performance, which places it among the varieties with the highest percentage of oil extraction.</p><p>The tree, of reduced vigor allows its use in intensive plantations. Its long, slightly branched shoots and the dark green color of the young wood give this olive a broom shape. The fields of olive groves of the Arbequina varieties show peculiar landscapes, very different from those contemplated, for example, in areas of Andalusia. It resists well the cold and the drought, it becomes relatively early tree. It begins to be productive in 10 or 15 years. This variety presents a period of average flowering in the first half of May. Its oils, with a color between greenish and yellow, have a fresh fruity aroma with aromas of almonds and other fruits. Its taste varies depending on the type of soil and climate. Bitter and bite very little but nothing, the note of astringency never appears and of entrance they present a great softness and offer a touch sensation of almond very nice and delicate. We could describe them as oils with harmonious characteristics, soft, light, delicate, sweet, almost always almonds and with a ripe fruit aroma (fruit and apple slice), in which exotic aromas can sometimes be seen. However, there is also the type of slightly fruity and slightly bitter, spicy and sweet fruity oil. This oil corresponds to the beginning of the season, when the olives are still green and this characteristic is logically reflected in the organoleptic profile of the oil.</p><p>Because of their composition they are somewhat more delicate than other varieties in the face of oxidation and once packed it is very important that they are protected from light and heat. It is noteworthy that the Arbequina is exquisite, when it is seasoned, for table use.</p>

pagina.titulo_gordal: Gordal
pagina.cuerpo_gordal: <p>It is also one of the typical table olives, its name of gordal comes from the size of its fruit that is a little rounded. Very large fruits and poor quality. It is grown and grown in Seville.</p><p>The variety Gordal Sevillana is cultivated mainly in the province of Seville where it has an approximate extension of about 30,000 hectares. Now, apart from Seville other provinces like Cordoba and Huelva also exist plantations of this variety. Other countries such as the United States, Argentina or even Israel have also encountered this type of plantation. It is also known as Bella de España, Morcal de Limón, etc. The tree from which the olive of Gordal Sevillana is extracted, is a vigorous tree, scarcely branched and with large leaves. Early flowering and hard curdling, so the use of pollinators improves productivity. The ripening fruit is dark green in color almost black, elongated oval with a heart shaped shape with few branches. Its bone is elongated with the bases pointed and slightly asymmetrical. Its productivity is variable and oil content is low, but it is considered a variety with the highest commercial value, due to its size and good pulp-bone ratio. Olive of the highest commercial value for its size and good pulp-bone ratio of 7.3. Otherwise it has no advantages; Low pulp quality, difficult pulp-bone separation, delicacy for industrial treatments.</p><p>As a table olive it is appreciated not only for its large size but also for its quality and its extraordinary flavor. It produces very unstable oil with rancimat of value 51.2. Low resistance to any insect pest that attacks the olive tree in general. Aspect to take into account when it is taken to new plantations in any country.</p>

pagina.titulo_hojiblanca: Hojiblanca
pagina.cuerpo_hojiblanca: <p>Comes from Lucena (Córdoba). Variety of dual aptitude, although mediocre in both cases; As table variety is known by the name of pearls of the Guadalquivir; High tolerance to limestone soils; Fruit of acceptable size. Also called Casta de Cabra or Lucentino, it is produced in the east of Seville, south of Cordoba and north of Malaga. It assumes 16% of the Andalusian production, on a land of about 217,000 hectares. It is typical of the oils of Cordova and the countryside, generally give oils of golden tones and of soft taste. The name comes from the whitish coloration of the base of the leaves.</p><p>Also it is known in Andalusia under the name of Lucentino, by the metallic reflections that have their leaves when it gives the sun to them. Hojiblanca olives serve both black table olives because of the firm texture of their pulp and for the production of oil.</p><p>The olive, although with many oscillations, is usually large to large, reaching on average 4.3 grams. Its shape is an almost perfect sphere with a high pulp / bone ratio, around 8. The fruit also withstands the cold well. Its flowering lasts the first two weeks of May having its fullness at the beginning of the second week. The maturation is somewhat late, from late November to late December and once ripe it shows resistance to detachment, which makes harvesting difficult. Its oil yield is low, with an average between 17-19%. The olive is of medium vigor to good, with long and fruitful branches although some pendulums. The tops maintain an average density and a regular leaf surface and are characterized by the light greenish gray color of their young wood. It withstands the cold and adapts perfectly to limestone. From the physico-chemical point of view, it has a very balanced fatty acid composition with relatively lower saturated acids than in the rest of the oils of other varieties. Its composition is ideal from the nutritional point of view. Oxidation stability is not high and it is recommended to keep these oils in the shelter of light and without excessive oxygenation during storage.</p><p>The oil has a good ratio of oleic acid (~ 75%) linoleic acid (~ 7%) with a low amount of fatty acids compared to other oils. These characteristics make oil produced with hojiblanca olive ideal for diets. From the organoleptic point of view, they present an immense range of flavors, although the vegetal flavors predominate. Common values ​​are the attributes of sweetness at the beginning of the tasting, fruity of fresh herb in the aroma, light bitterness to green fruit and other fruits that sometimes reminisce to a Macedonian, light spicy in throat and almond final aftertaste. These oils have a huge variety of flavors, the most characteristic attributes being a touch of initial sweetness, with hints of green fruit bitter, and a final touch of almond.</p><p>Recommended for frying, this oil is also ideal for making bread, pasta and cakes, for the perfect consistency it gives the masses. These olives are also widely used and appreciated as black table olives thanks to the firmness of their flesh.</p>

pagina.titulo_lechin: Lechín
pagina.cuerpo_lechin: <p>This variety is characteristic of the provinces of Seville, Cordoba, Cadiz, Malaga and Huelva. Its name is due to the whitish color of its pulp and its oily wort, a mixture of vegetation water and oil. It is a very vigorous variety, able to withstand droughts and cold winter weather, adapting very well to limestone and poor soil. This variety occupies approximately 185,000 hectares of the province of Granada and a small part of Seville. The tree is characterized by being very vigorous and of great roots, of open bearing and thick density in its cup. It is a rustic tree, tolerant to the cold, to the drought and to limestone soils and of poor quality. Although it is productive, its flowering season is average and there are many faults in the harvest by flowering of flower, and its collection is costly by resistance to the detachment and size of the fruit. The leaf is small in size, short and slightly broadened in its half, flat, showing a lively yellowish green on the beam and greyish green on the underside.</p><p>The medium olive has a weight close to 3 grams and is ellipsoidal in shape, slightly curved in the back and slightly asymmetrical. The apex is rounded and occasionally has a small nipple. Its color is black in maturation. It has a low average oil content, of the order of 18%, and a high ratio of pulp to bone around 7/2 to 8/5. The ripening of the fruit is early. From the organoleptic point of view, it is a fluid oil with vegetable flavors, medium bitterness and a green almond flavor in the mouth. It is a fluid oil with a medium, grassy, ​​olives and balanced aroma. The taste shows bitterness and medium beak in intensity and a remnant to green almond in mouth. Freshly produced is very pleasant. The high content of pallic acid (12-13%) is compensated with the reduced content of stearic acid, and thus the total saturated acids are low in the oils produced with these olives. However, the combination produces unstable organoleptic characteristics, with a tendency to oxidation. The taste is slightly bitter, reminiscent of green almonds. From the chemical point of view, its composition makes it relatively unstable against oxidation with loss of its organoleptic values ​​relatively rapidly over time. It is not frequent the commercialization of oils exclusively with the variety Lechín, but usually it is used complementing other varieties like Hojiblanca and Picual. It is the ideal oil for tapas and sweets.</p>
